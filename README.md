# The idea

### Life on earth
Mapmaking usually consumes quite a lot of time and human resources, which generates lots of expenses for development companies. Automating this process would shorten the time it takes to create a map, directly lowering the time it takes to produce the whole game. It would also minimize the number of employees, thus cutting the expenses on a given project.
We want to investigate the efficiency and profitability of this method and see how difficult it could potentially be. Our project does not rely on weather nor where the pictures are taken, because we can use anything visible from space to create a map, for example, clouds, mountains, forests, oceans etc. The data we want to gather is photos captured during the day, since our program won’t save any photos during the night, it will also save ISS positions and the hour of taking the photo. Additionally, if there’s no problem surrounding this, we would like to save the data about the electromagnetic field, pressure, and other data from sensors, because we would like to use them to create a browser game.
We are very invested in this project, and it means a lot to us, because we are sure that this can influence the production of new video games and make the job of many easier. We are very determined in what we’re doing since we believe it could be revolutionizing.

### Data

Satellite data will be gathered in space and saved as images to minimize the risk of a code error. This data will be converted into maps for video games with the help of AI and algorithms. To achieve that, we will use the Open cv2 library in Python and turn the photos into an artistic 2D map, we will replace geographical entities like mountains, oceans and even clouds into something more beautiful that can be used in a game. We are going to do this by converting the images and connecting them together to make them look surreal, it will be done fully automatic and because of that we can make enormous and beautiful maps without any effort, at least that’s the plan. The whole project will be documented and published on GitHub, and it will be made free and available for everybody.
